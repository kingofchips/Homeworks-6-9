# Homeworks-6-9
Contains a few exercices from homeworks 6-9.
I started working today on the homework, so because of the rush, the problems are not fully resolved, and some of the code may be poorly written.
However, I did want to have something prepared, to not get grade 0 on the lab, and to also try to understand new OOP concepts, which were
presented at the courses and labs.
